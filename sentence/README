The tool in this directory identifies sentence boundaries in UTF-8 or
plain ASCII (7-bit) English text. The output is suitable for
futher processing by the 'tokenise' tool also provided here. The file
sentence.flex was written by John Carroll (University of Sussex, 2003)
based on earlier work by Eirik Hektoen, Guido Minnen and Greg
Grefenstette.

The sentence boundary detector uses the immediate context (capitals,
other punctuation etc.) to distinguish between periods used to end
sentences and those used to end abbreviations (including titles and
initials).  The program assumes there is a sentence boundary wherever
there is a blank line, or whitespace preceded by valid sentence final
punctuation and followed by a capital letter.

The program is based on a set of relatively simple rules, and is
therefore far from failproof.

Example usage:

$ sentence < sentence.test

An -x option puts the sentence splitter in XML mode, in which only text
inside <text>...</text> elements will be considered.
