              USING THE GDE TO DEVELOP GRAMMARS

You can use the GDE on its own if you want to develop your own grammars
or experiment with existing ones; in that case, read on. On the other
hand, if you are not interested in grammars themselves but just want to
get the RASP tools to analyse text then please go to directory scripts/.

To invoke the GDE using one of the pre-built binaries, enter one of the
following commands at the Unix shell prompt:

   bin/ix86_linux/gde
   bin/x86_64_linux/gde
   bin/ix86_darwin/gde
   bin/x86_64_darwin/gde

depending on your processor architecture and operating system. If you want
to modify the behaviour of the GDE, you can edit the source code and build
a new binary using the Makefile in this directory.

The full set of commands which are available in the GDE is described
in the user manual:

   Carroll, J., E. Briscoe & C. Grover (1991) A development environment
   for large natural language grammars. Computer Laboratory, Cambridge
   University, UK, Technical Report 233.

For convenience, this is included in the RASP distribution, as
manuals/gde/ucam-cl-tr-233.pdf . However, please note that Chapter 6
'Using the Morphological Analyser with the GDE' is no longer applicable.
Visit <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/anlt.html> for references to
work that has used the GDE.

The GDE provides many advanced facilities for developing grammars, but
you need to know only four commands to get started. They are 'read',
'set', 'parse' and 'quit'. For example:

   Gde> read grammar_file
   Gde> set defining messages
   Gde> parse 
   Gde> quit 

If you are running one of the pre-built binaries then there is a grammar
already loaded (this is the grammar in prob/data/tsg15), plus statistical
data associated with this grammar, and code for statistical parse
disambiguation. If you want to load your own grammar into the GDE you
should first give the GDE command 'clear'.  You may also want to set the
flag 'tagged words' to off if the lexical entries associated with your
grammar are for words rather than part-of-speech tags.
