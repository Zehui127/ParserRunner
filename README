                    RASP - Robust Parsing System for English

                            OPEN-SOURCE VERSION 3.3
                                 October 2019

LICENCE

The open-source version of RASP is released under the LGPL open-source licence.
See COPYING and COPYING.LESSER for details.


CONTENTS

There are a number of directories at the top level. They are:

  "gde" -- source code and help files for the grammar development
  environment and parser. The directory also contains a "README" file
  giving instructions on how use the environment on its own to develop
  grammars.

  "manuals" -- documentation for the PoS tagset used, gde and grammar,
  tsg-doc.pdf is a general `howto' and `best practice' document for
  RASP which we recommend every user reads

  "morph" -- contains source code for the Sussex
  lemmatiser / morph analysis and generation system (see "README" file).


  "prob" -- contains the grammar used for parsing and associated
  statistical model, training material, the grammar development corpus,
  and evaluation data and source code for carrying out evaluations.

  "scripts" -- unix shell scripts for running the whole analysis system,
  or just the parser.

  "sentence" -- source code for sentence boundary detection.

  "tag" -- source code for the PoS tagger, and data files
  (lexicon etc) to allow it to be used in conjunction with the tag
  sequence grammar.

  "tokenise" -- source code for tokenisation (assuming
  previous sentence boundary detection) and compatible with the tagger,
  morphological analysis and parser.



To run the whole system on English text, see the section below on
running the system, and also the file "scripts/README".  To use any of
the modules on its own, see the "README" file in the relevant
directory.


BUILDING THE SYSTEM

To build the system, execute "make" with no parameters in the top-level
directory.  This will download and build bison, flex and libdb,
download Clozure CL and build the 5 main RASP modules (sentence, token, label,
morpha and gde).


RUNNING THE SYSTEM

There are two shell scripts, rasp.sh and rasp_parse.sh, in the scripts
directory which run the complete RASP NL analysis system and just the
parser respectively.

Examples of usage of rasp.sh (assuming "scripts" is the current
directory):

  $ ./rasp.sh -m < file.txt > analysed.txt
  $ echo "This is a test." | ./rasp.sh -p'-os -u'
  $ ./rasp.sh -mh < README > README.parses

Examples of usage of rasp_parse.sh: 

  $ ./rasp_parse.sh -l/tmp/log1 -s -t5 < tagged.txt
  $ ./rasp_parse.sh -n1000 -ogw <<EOF
  ^_^ Yesterday_RT Swapo_NP1 register+ed_VVD its_APP$ opposition_NN1
  EOF

README files are also provided in each component's directory.


SUPPORT

The RASP system is derived in part from portions of the Alvey NL Tools;
see <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/anlt.html>. Development of the
RASP system was funded by the UK EPSRC within the project "Robust
Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP)" (grants GR/N36462 and GR/N36493).

The system is distributed for non-commercial use, and without any
guarantee of support. We do however welcome reports of bugs or
shortcomings; also fixes or work-rounds sent as email. But before
reporting a bug, please read the documentation for the software and
grammar since the behaviour may already be known about, or be an
intentional feature. Contact information for the  RASP developers
can be found on the iLexIR website <http://ilexir.co.uk/>.

More extensive support and advice is available on a paid consultancy
basis.

The open-source distribution is a-cut down version of the CVS archive and
may contain references to files that are not included.
